The goal was to analyze successful projects funded through Kickstarter and provide actionable insights.
Approach
• Data Cleaning & Modeling: Removed redundancies and structured the data for meaningful analysis. Created a calendar table with financial months and quarters for better time-based insights.
• Dashboard Creation: Developed an interactive and insightful dashboard to visualize project outcomes, locations, and categories. Integrated KPIs to provide an overview of project performance.
• Dynamic Visualizations: Leveraged parameters and slicers to enable dynamic exploration of data, allowing stakeholders to filter and analyze results based on different criteria.
• Advanced DAX Measures: Created DAX measures to identify top successful projects based on the amount raised and number of backers. Additionally, calculated the goal range for successful projects.
• Reports & Analysis: Generated reports for yearly backers and project counts, conducted state-level analysis for projects by country, and compared goal amounts with pledged amounts to assess project performance.
This project strengthened my skills in data analysis, dashboard development, and storytelling with data, showcasing the power of visualization in driving data-driven decision-making.
