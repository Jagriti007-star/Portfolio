Objective:
To analyze the Highcloud Airlines dataset to determine load factors for different carriers and provide insights for optimizing airline operations.



Approach:
Data Extraction & Preparation: Extracted data from SQL and created a date table to define the financial year for better temporal analysis.
KPI Development: Built KPIs to evaluate weekday vs. weekend performance, total passengers, and total flights.
Dynamic Visualizations: Utilized slicers to enable dynamic filtering of origin and destination countries, allowing for focused analysis.
DAX Measures: Created DAX measures to accurately calculate the load factor for different carriers.
Top Carrier Analysis: Applied visual-level filters to identify and showcase the top 5 carriers based on their performance.
This project showcased my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using Power BI, enhancing decision-making for airline operations management.
